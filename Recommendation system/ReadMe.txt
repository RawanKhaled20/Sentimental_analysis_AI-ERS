This part of the project was completely developed by me "Eng: Rawan Khaled"
This is a recommendation system that uses the AI models in this repository to perform sentimental analysis on different types of data
(writtten text, Recorded audio , Images and Real-time videos). In addition to that it s a bilingual analysis we can understand Arabic and English reviews using googletrans library.
Also we developed a custom class to save the number of instance any product is recommended or not based on its sentiment so that it can be easier for users to extract the recommended and unrecommended products.
